    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These decadent double-cut boneless pork chops are a savory showstopper, bursting with a sweet-and-smoky stuffing that’s anything but ordinary. Crisp bacon, sautéed onions, and diced poblano peppers form the base of the filling, while juicy yellow peaches add a bright, fruity contrast. Crushed saltines bind the mixture, infused with fresh thyme, a pinch of cayenne, and a splash of chicken broth for moisture.
        The seasoned pork chops are seared to golden perfection, then oven-finished with a buttery balsamic pan sauce that enhances every bite. The result? A balanced, gourmet main dish where the richness of pork meets the vibrant flavors of summer peaches and herbs—comfort food elevated.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>Stuffing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 strips bacon, sliced into ¼-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li> 
        <li>1 large yellow peach, peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
        <li>8 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Porkchops</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 double-cut boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, cold</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with oven rack in center position.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper; cook until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add peach; cook until tender and starting to render some juice. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir saltines, thyme, black pepper, ¼ teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper into peach mixture; add 2 tablespoons chicken broth to moisten as needed. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Lay pork chops flat onto your work surface. Cut a pocket in center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on fat side of chops, exactly halfway down, using the tip of a knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make pocket incisions at least 2 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Fill pockets with peach stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly; season both sides chops with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chops; sear until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip chops and transfer skillet to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chops to a plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to the stovetop; place a towel over the hot handle. Add ¼ cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Off heat, stir in butter. Taste; adjust seasoning if desired. Serve sauce over pork chops.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Chef's Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You can use a jalapeño or other green chile pepper instead of a poblano. Feel free to substitute any fresh fruit you'd like for the peach and any fresh herb for the thyme.</li>
    <li>If you like, you can use crumbled bread cubes, bread crumbs, or even cornbread instead of saltine crackers.</li>
    <li>Just like you can use any stuffing you want, you can use any liquid and vinegar you like in your sauce.</li>
    </ul>
